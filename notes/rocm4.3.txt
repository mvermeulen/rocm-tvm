Notes for building with ROCm 4.3
--------------------------------
1. When building with llvmorg-12.0.0 version of llvm-project, encountered
   problems because ROCm runtime was looking to load llvm13git versions of
   bitcode files and compiler was too old.

2. Was able to build with tip of llvm-project if I passed in the flag:
   -Wno-deprecated-declarations, as well as made sure fixes for PR #8682 were
   present.

3. Also tried building with the /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/llvm-config version of the
   compiler.  This encountered some issues because AMD ROCm compiler was
   forked before PR #7617 was merged, changing CreateAtomicRMW calls.
   Worked around this by backing these off in sources at:
   http://github.com/mvermeulen/tvm in branch rocm-4.3-test.
